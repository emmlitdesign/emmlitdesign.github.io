      <p>The people upstairs all practise ballet <br>Their bedroom is full of conducted tours. <br> They celebrate week-ends all the week. <br> They try to get their parties to mix <br> And when their fun at last abates, <br> I might love the people upstairs more

    ABOUT THE AUTHOR 
  </h3>
</div>


  <div class="row1">
    <h4> <br> 
    Nash was born in Rye, New York, the son of Mattie (Chenault) and Edmund Strudwick Nash. His father owned and operated an import–export company, and because of business obligations, the family often relocated. Nash was descended from Abner Nash, an early governor of North Carolina. The city of Nashville, Tennessee, was named after Abner's brother, Francis, a Revolutionary War general. <br>
      Throughout his life, Nash loved to rhyme. <em>"I think in terms of rhyme, and have since I was six years old," </em> he stated in a 1958 news interview. He had a fondness for crafting his own words whenever rhyming words did not exist but admitted that crafting rhymes was not always the easiest task.</h4> <br>
    <h4>
     When Nash was not writing poems, he made guest appearances on comedy and radio shows and toured the United States and the United Kingdom and gave lectures at colleges and universities.
    
    Nash was regarded with respect by the literary establishment, and his poems were frequently anthologized even in serious collections like Selden Rodman's 1946 <em>A New Anthology of Modern Poetry. </em>
    
    Nash was the lyricist for the Broadway musical One Touch of Venus and collaborated with the librettist S. J. Perelman and the composer Kurt Weill. The show included the notable song <em>"Speak Low." </em> He also wrote the lyrics for the 1952 revue Two's Company.
